### Cloning Down Your Repository

If you already have a personal repository:

* In the terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/<your_username_here>/exceptional-realty`
* A folder with your previous work will appear in the IDE file tree.

If you want to use the demo repository to follow along:

* In your terminal, type `git clone https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/exceptional-realty-demo`.
* Type `cd exceptional-realy-demo` to navigate into the folder.
* Type `git fetch html-tables`, the branch for this lesson.
* Type `git checkout html-tables`, and you're good to go!
